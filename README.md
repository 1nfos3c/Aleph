Disclaimer : This is a one day project.  

Hi! This is **Aleph**, a one word wordlist generator.  
Just give it a keyword and a mode (--simple,--normal,--advanced) and it will create a wordlist based on that.

You can also give **Aleph** an url, and it will scrape that webpage and links on that webpage for unique words. (For example: Aleph.py https://www.google.com --simple)

Feel free to contribute!

**Aleph** is Linux only due to dynamic printing in the terminal.
It might work on OSX but it probably won't look pretty!
