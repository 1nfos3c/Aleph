# Aleph

Hi! This is **Aleph**, a one word wordlist generator.

## Usage
Just give **Aleph** a single keyword or URL and a mode (--simple,--normal,--advanced) and it will create a wordlist based on that.  
When supplied with a URL, **Aleph** will scrape the webpage and its links for unique words.  
You are now able to change configuration options in the config file located in ```src/```.  

## Compatibility
**Aleph** works with **Python3** on both **Linux** and **OSX**.
To install the required dependencies use:  
```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
