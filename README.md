Hi! This is **Aleph**, a one word wordlist generator.  
Just give it a keyword and a mode (--simple,--normal,--advanced) and it will create a wordlist based on that.  
Feel free to contribute!

**Aleph** is Linux only due to dynamic printing in the terminal.
It might work on OSX but it probably won't look pretty!
