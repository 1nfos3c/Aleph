# Aleph

Hi! This is **Aleph**, a one word wordlist generator.

![Aleph](http://i67.tinypic.com/9kwgfs.png)  

## Usage
Just give it a keyword and a mode (--simple,--normal,--advanced) and it will create a wordlist based on that.
You can add custom affixes by adding them to ```src/affixes```.    
Feel free to contribute!  

**Aleph** works on both Linux and OSX.
